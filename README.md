# Projects-Portfolio

## Description

My Projects portfolio showcases projects that I've built and worked on that exercised core concepts in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The portfolio includes an "About Me" section which contains information about myself, a "Projects" section showing projects that I've either built from scratch or refactored, and a "Contact" section where information can be found to reach me. This portfolio will provide employers a convenient way to view my work when considering me for employment opportunities.
